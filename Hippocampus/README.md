# Introduction

Beta version of Hippocampus, here, we are trying to implement NodeJs and Bootstrap to our Project.

# Hippocampus

In order to use this project, you need to clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/FelipeFTN/Web-Design.git```
We are using DDD for Design Pattern. You can test it for yourself just by running ```npm install``` to install dependencies and then run ```node server.js``` to start the server that is running on the port 3000 (localhost:3000).
All the html files will be inside the static directory.
