# Introduction

This is a Web design project made for educational purposes using some of the most popular web design languages 

## My Projects

Here, I am using some HTML, CSS and Javascript Knowledge to build this projects

- Jokenpo - A rock paper scissors simple game made with a Artificial inteligence playing against the player

- Hippocampus - A study plan website that organize the subjects according to the time

- Node.js - Some simple Nodejs modules that I was using to improve my Javascript abilities

- Estrategy Game - A simple Javascript multiplayer game, still in development working with canvas.

- ByteBank - A simple bank system using OOP in NodeJs

### Jokenpo

In order to play this game, you need to clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/FelipeFTN/Web-Design.git``` and just executing the *index.html* file and have fun! ðŸ˜‰
I am still trying to improve the Artificial Inteligence that plays against the player. If you want to contribute with this project, you can explore the IAScript.js and help us to fix the AI.

### Hippocampus

This project is currently in development, it was originally made just using HTML and Javascript, now we are trying to adapt it to NodeJs.
You can run it by running ```npm install``` in your Terminal inside the Hippocampus directory to install all the project dependecies. After that, run ```npm start``` or ```node server.js``` to run the Web server, it will run on your localhost at the *port 3000*.
If you want to help us on this project we encourage you to clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/FelipeFTN/Web-Design.git```.

### Estrategy Game

I still do not have a name for this project, I use that as a hobbie for web game development.
It should be a 1v1 estrategy online game, still in development.
